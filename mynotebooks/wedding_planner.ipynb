Here’s a structured plan covering flights from Bangalore and the core vendor categories (catering, décor, DJ, photography). I’ve pulled in solid Zurich-area options from the vendor lists I have, with quick notes and direct links so you can start reviewing.\n",

      "- Typical approach I recommend:\n",
      "  - Look for 1-stop options via major hubs (DXB, AUH, DEL, MAA, FRA, MUC) or a multi-city route with a short layover.\n",
      "  - Consider Swiss/ Lufthansa/ Air India/ Emirates partners for smoother connection times and easier group check-in.\n",

      "5) Venue and weekend timeline\n",
