      "Real answer: There isn’t a real capital of the Moon. It’s not a sovereign nation. But in a sci‑fi world I enjoy, the Moon has a capital named Lunopolis.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Name: Lunopolis\n",
      "- Location: In the rim of the Clavius Crater on the near side, a city carved into lava tubes and crater walls, ringed by solar domes and orbital elevators. It sits in perpetual daylight along the rim, with shadowed craters below serving as quiet refuges and farms.\n",
      "- Government: A Lunar Council of nine district delegates governs from the Citadel of Dawn. An executive Prime Lander handles day-to-day affairs, with ministries for Living Systems, Energy, and Archives.\n",
      "- Architecture: A blend of glass, basalt, and regolith bricks. Tall glass towers rise from the crater rim, connected by solar-arched walkways and tram-lines that glide along the crater lip. Subterranean farms and lava-tube habitats provide food and shelter.\n",
      "- Economy: Helium-3 mining, water ice reclamation, and advanced 3D-printed components. Solar collectors and space elevators feed the city and its colonies.\n",
      "- Culture: A music-and-arts hub that fuses lunar dust dances with Earth-born styles. Annual Lunar Sundial Festival marks the lunar month; the Archive of Echoes preserves transmissions from Earth and the old solar system.\n",
      "- Notable landmarks: The Dawn Spire (the tallest observatory and government beacon), the Archive of Echoes (data vault and museum), Sea Glass Plaza (a radiant public square), and the Gate to Earth (the main spaceport and ceremonial doorway to the Earth).\n",
      "- Vibe: A glittering, exhausting, wondrous frontier city where science, governance, and art orbit each other like moons around a shared sun.\n",

      "If you’d like a different flavor, I can rename Lunopolis or relocate the capital to the polar regions, a sea of glass domes, or a cavern metropolis beneath the south pole. What mood should the capital have? austere and high-tech, mythic and ceremonial, gritty and industrial, or romantic and hopeful?\n"
